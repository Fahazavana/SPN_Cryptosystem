# Substitution Permutation Network (SPN) cipher method

The goal is to present a code for illustration of the SPN cipher method (Block cipher).

We present here :
* The encryption
* The de-encryption
* An Attack (differntial cryptanalysis)

There is two code `SPN_bitwise.py` written in an advanced way and  `SPN_string.py` written in some basic way, easy to understand (Near the way that it was explained).
